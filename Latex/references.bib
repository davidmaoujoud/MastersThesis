abstract = {This paper formulates the optimal control problem for a class of mathematical models in which the system to be controlled is characterized by a finite-state discrete-time Markov process. The states of this internal process are not directly observable by the controller; rather, he has available a set of observable outputs that are only probabilistically related to the internal state of the system. The formulation is illustrated by a simple machine-maintenance example, and other specific application areas are also discussed. The paper demonstrates that, if there are only a finite number of control intervals remaining, then the optimal payoff function is a piecewise-linear, convex function of the current state probabilities of the internal Markov process. In addition, an algorithm for utilizing this property to calculate the optimal control policy and payoff function for any finite horizon is outlined. These results are illustrated by a numerical example for the machine-maintenance problem.},

We begin by introducing the theory of Markov decision processes (mdps) and partially observable MDPs (pomdps). We then outline a novel algorithm for solving pomdps off line and show how, in some cases, a finite-memory controller can be extracted from the solution to a POMDP. We conclude with a discussion of how our approach relates to previous work, the complexity of finding exact solutions to pomdps, and of some possibilities for finding approximate solutions."

abstract="We study planning in relational Markov decision processes involving discrete and continuous states and actions, and an unknown number of objects. This combination of hybrid relational domains has so far not received a lot of attention. While both relational and hybrid approaches have been studied separately, planning in such domains is still challenging and often requires restrictive assumptions and approximations. We propose HYPE: a sample-based planner for hybrid relational domains that combines model-based approaches with state abstraction. HYPE samples episodes and uses the previous episodes as well as the model to approximate the Q-function. In addition, abstraction is performed for each sampled episode, this removes the complexity of symbolic approaches for hybrid relational domains. In our empirical evaluations, we show that HYPE is a general and widely applicable planner in domains ranging from strictly discrete to strictly continuous to hybrid ones, handles intricacies such as unknown objects and relational models. Moreover, empirical results showed that abstraction provides significant improvements.",

Agent-centered search methods interleave planning and plan execution and restrict planning to the part of the domain around the current state of the agent, for example, the current location of a mobile robot or the current board position of a game. These methods can execute actions in the presence of time constraints and often have a small sum of planning and execution cost, both because they trade off planning and execution cost and because they allow agents to gather information early in nondeterministic domains, which reduces the amount of planning they have to perform for unencountered situations. These advantages become important as more intelligent systems are interfaced with the world and have to operate autonomously in complex environments. Agent-centered search methods have been applied to a variety of domains, including traditional search, strips-type planning, moving-target search, planning with totally and partially observable Markov decision process models, reinforcement learning, constraint satisfaction, and robot navigation. I discuss the design and properties of several agent-centered search methods, focusing on robot exploration and localization.}, number={4}, journal={AI Magazine}, author={Koenig, Sven}, year={2001}, month={Dec.}, pages={109} }

 abstract = {This paper formulates the optimal control problem for a class of mathematical models in which the system to be controlled is characterized by a finite-state discrete-time Markov process. The states of this internal process are not directly observable by the controller; rather, he has available a set of observable outputs that are only probabilistically related to the internal state of the system. The formulation is illustrated by a simple machine-maintenance example, and other specific application areas are also discussed. The paper demonstrates that, if there are only a finite number of control intervals remaining, then the optimal payoff function is a piecewise-linear, convex function of the current state probabilities of the internal Markov process. In addition, an algorithm for utilizing this property to calculate the optimal control policy and payoff function for any finite horizon is outlined. These results are illustrated by a numerical example for the machine-maintenance problem.},

abstract = {R. Howard (R. Howard.1960. Dynamic Programming and Markov Processes. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York.) and A. Manne (A. Manne. 1960. Linear programming and sequential decisions. Management Science, April.) have suggested two methods for optimizing average costs per unit time by means of a sequential decision rule. This rule gives order quantities as a function of initial stock levels, and is based upon the assumption of a Markov process which is both homogenous and discrete. The formulation does not include any restrictive hypothesis on the structure of costs. This paper presents a synthesis of both dynamic and linear programming methods applicable to the same kind of model for the case of time discounting.},

abstract = "The area of learning in multi-agent systems is today one of the most fertile grounds for interaction between game theory and artificial intelligence. We focus on the foundational questions in this interdisciplinary area, and identify several distinct agendas that ought to, we argue, be separated. The goal of this article is to start a discussion in the research community that will result in firmer foundations for the area.11This article has a long history and owes many debts. A first version was presented at the NIPS workshop, Multi-Agent Learning: Theory and Practice, in 2002. A later version was presented at the AAAI Fall Symposium in 2004 [Y. Shoham, R. Powers, T. Grenager, On the agenda(s) of research on multi-agent learning, in: AAAI 2004 Symposium on Artificial Multi-Agent Learning (FS-04-02), AAAI Press, 2004]. Over time it has gradually evolved into the current form, as a result of our own work in the area as well as the feedback of many colleagues. We thank them all collectively, with special thanks to members of the multi-agent group at Stanford in the past three years. Rakesh Vohra and Michael Wellman provided detailed comments on the latest draft which resulted in substantive improvements, although we alone are responsible for the views put forward. This work was supported by NSF ITR grant IIS-0205633 and DARPA grant HR0011-05-1."

abstract="In this paper we develop a notion of ``objective trust'' for Software Agents, that is trust of, or between, Agents based on actual experiences between those Agents. Experiential objective trust allows Agents to make decisions about how to select other Agents when a choice has to be made. We define a mechanism for such an ``objective Trust-Based Agent'' (oTB-Agent), and present experimental results in a simulated trading environment based on an Intelligent Networks (IN) scenario. The trust one Agent places in another is dynamic, updated on the basis of each experience. We use this to investigate three questions related to trust in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), first how trust affects the formation of trading partnerships, second, whether trust developed over a period can equate to ``loyalty'' and third whether a less than scrupulous Agent can exploit the individual nature of trust to its advantage.",
